# rembg trainer

## Please don't use just yet! Huge improvements are coming.

This code allows you to easily train U2-Net model in [ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) format to use with [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg]) tool.

This work is based off [U2Net](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net) repo, which is under Apache license. The derivative work is loicensed under MIT; do as you please with it.

Default parameters are fine-tuned for maximum performance on systems with 32gb of processing memory, like the Apple M1 Pro â€” 25 crops are loaded in memory per iteration thanks to 8 loader threads, which consumes about 26gb of VRAM. Adjust accordingly.

If the training is interrupted for any reason, don't worry â€” the program saves its state regularly, allowing you to resume from where you left off.

## Fancy a go?

- Download latest release
- Install `requirements.txt`
- Put your images into `images` folder
- Put their masks into `masks` folder; or see [below](#mask-extraction)
- Launch python3 u2net_train.py --help for more details on supported command line flags
- Launch script with your desired configuration
- Go grab yourself a [nice latte](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/h75W1uhL-iQ) and wait........... and wait.....
- Once you've had your fill of waiting, here's how you use resulting model with rembg:

```bash
rembg p -w input output -m u2net_custom -x '{"model_path": "/saved_models/u2net/2700.onnx"}'
# input â€” folder with images to have their backgrounds removed
# output â€” folder for resulting images processed with custom model
# adjust path(s) as necessary!
```

## Mask extraction

If you already have a bunch of images with removed background, then you can create masks off them using the provided `alpha.py` script. Create a directory called `clean`, put your pngs there, and launch the script.

But fair warning mate: the script is very CPU-heavy. Oh, and you'll need the `ImageMagick` tool installed and present in your PATH.

So, at the end of the day, you will end up with the following folder structure:

- `images` â€” source images, will be needed for training
- `masks` â€” required for training, to teach model where the background was
- `clean` â€” images with removed background, to extract masks (they're not used for actual training)
